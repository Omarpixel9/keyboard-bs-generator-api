# Corporate Bullshit/Buzzword Generator API

Corporate bullshit is the icing on the cake, proof that not even the business world takes the business world seriously. People get annoyed about it but don’t do anything about it, they give its use in meetings the dignity of a response rather than someone saying “what the fuck are you talking about?!” Even Googling “how to deal with corporate bullshit” renders no exact matches and very related matches.

So, I made this lovely little corporate bullshit generator to randomly picked out three phrases, which can help your application get ahead in an industry where spin, buzzwords and vagueness reign supreme.

 It will sound so good that your users will just nod enthusiastically even though they have no idea.

## Few bullshit examples
